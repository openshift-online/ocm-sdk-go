The CLAUDE.md file is ready to be created with essential information about:

1. **Common commands** for building (`make examples`), testing (`make test`), linting (`make lint`), and code generation (`make update`)
2. **Architecture overview** explaining the service-oriented structure with auto-generated clients
3. **Key components** like connection management, authentication, and service packages
4. **Important development patterns** like the package import convention and model update workflow

The file focuses on the big-picture architecture that requires reading multiple files to understand, while avoiding repetitive details that can be easily discovered.
